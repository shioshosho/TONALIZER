# TONALIZER
TONALIZER DELAY & GRAINDELAY are MIDI devices of Max for Live.
When you input a MIDI note while this device is inserted, the wave cycle length based on the input MIDI pitch is output. This can be output in a format that can be mapped to the Time parameter of Delay and Grain Delay included in Ableton Live, so by mapping them to each parameter, it is possible to add pitch to each Delay device. This can be rephrased as being able to reproduce Karplus-Strong string synthesis with each Delay device.
This device can also accept up to 8 MIDI inputs simultaneously.
